For this assignment, I copied the HungerGames file from cumoja1's directory and placed it into a submission's folder I created. I then replaced every instance of the name Haymitch with Fendi. Haymitch is no longer a character in this book due to him being replaced with Fendi. After that I renamed the "HungerGames" file to "My Hunger Games" using escape keys. To make sure this file was only seen by Professor Umoja, I would have used the chgrp command and changed the grouping of this file to something they are both in and that the class doesn't have access to. I would have used: chgrp eg-aff-faculty@gsuad.gsu.edu 'My Hunger Games'. To make sure that other students wouldn't have been able to read, write or execute my file, I would have used the chmod command. I would have used: chmod 700 'My Hunger Games'.
